<p>Big Shoulders is a family of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the City of Chicago&apos;s Brand Standards. The family&apos;s tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago&apos;s multiple histories in railway transport, journalism, advertising, and public political action.</p>

<p>Big Shoulders language support includes full covers of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.</p>

<p>The Family consists in two variants of optical sizes, Text and Display, with eight fonts each, ranging from Thin to Black weights. Both variants are now available as variable fonts.</p>
